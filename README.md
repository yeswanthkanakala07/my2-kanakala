### My favourite vacation spot is Maldives.

The Maldives is renowed for its perfect **natural beauty and stunning landscapes**.<br>
This is a perfect vacation spot with luxurious resorts and also popular for diverse marine life.<br>
Apart from natural beauty, one can enjoy various **water sports and adventure activities**.
